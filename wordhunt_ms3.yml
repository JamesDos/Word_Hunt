  Our project is a clone of the game-pigeon game "Word Hunt". In our version of
  word hunt, the game displays in a GUI a 4 x 4 grid of characters from 
  which the user is prompted to form words from the board. Word are created by 
  selecting adjacent letters in the board and scored based on their length if
  they are determined to be a valid english word. There is also a timer which,
  when it hits zero, causes the game to end and takes the user to an ending 
  screen revealing all the longest possible words that could have been formed
  in the board. In our version word hunt, we had two modes: normal mode and
  survival mode. Normal mode functions that same as game-pigeon word hunt but in 
  survival mode, the user starts with less time, but every word that the user 
  inputs adds time to the timer.
