Welcome to BNJ Word Hunt!

BNJ Word Hunt is our take on the popular game pigeon I-phone game Word Hunt

Suppose the following letters are generated:
C A T D
W O F O
I R D G
N O A S


Forming Words:
- Words are formed by connecting adjacent (including diagonally) letter tiles 
  with each other
- Tiles that are currently being used for a word cannot be used again for that word
- Only words that are greater than length 2, have not been previously entered, 
  and are valid words according to the scrabble dictionary are accepted
- CAT, DOGS, WORDS, and TORN are all examples of valid words for the board above
- AT would be rejected since it is less than length 2
- TFGD would be rejected since its is not a real word
- If you input the same word multiple times, you will not get additional points

Our game comes in two modes:

Normal Mode:
- Words are scored based on their length. 
- Word lengths of 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and >7 have point values of 100, 400, 800, 1400, 2000, and 3000 respectively
- You have 60 seconds to score as much points as you can before the timer hits zero
- The game ends when the timer hits zero, sending you to the ending screen which reveals 
  your final score and the longest possible words that could have been made from that board

Survival Mode:
- The rules of survival mode are mostly the same as that of normal mode but with a few differences
- Instead of having a total time of 60 seconds, you start at 20 seconds
- Each valid word you input will increase your remaining time based on its length
- Word lengths of 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and >7  give an extra 5, 7, 12, 20, 30, and 45 seconds respectively
- The scoring of the words is the same as normal mode and the game ends when the timer hits zero

Have Fun Playing!
