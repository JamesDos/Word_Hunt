  Our project is a clone of the game-pigeon game "Word Hunt". In our version of
  word hunt, the game displays a 4 x 4 grid of characters from which the user 
  is prompted to form words from the board. Word are created by selecting
  adjacent letters in the board. Our version of word hunt accepts words using
   the same rules as the game pigeon word hunt.
